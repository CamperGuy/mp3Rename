# mp3Rename
A Python script to clean up the .mp3 files produced by youtube-dl

Expected name format:
SomeArtist - SomeTitle-11digitVideoID.mp3

Additionally, some Youtube-specific tags artists like to put in their titles like (Official video) or [Lyric Video] will also be removed, leaving you with a clean name
